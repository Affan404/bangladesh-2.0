                <p>Dr. Muhammad Yunus, a Bangladeshi economist and social entrepreneur, won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2006 for pioneering microfinance and microcredit. Founder of Grameen Bank in 1983, Yunus empowered millions of impoverished people, particularly women, by offering small loans without collateral, enabling them to start businesses and break the cycle of poverty. His innovative approach challenged traditional banking, proving that the poor are creditworthy. Born in 1940 in Chittagong, Bangladesh, Yunus earned his PhD in Economics from Vanderbilt University.</p>
